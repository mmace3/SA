# SA - Stock Assessment Models

Code to explore and understand different common stock assessment models. 

One goal is to implement some of the common stock assessment models in different computer languages/software. Another goal is to explore the effects of different types of data and data of varying quality on estimates from these models. Also explore how much and what types of data are necessary to get decent estimates from these models. The plan is to determine this partly by conducting simulations where the values of different parameters are known and compare to model estimates.
